        During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced
        much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in
        Berne. In 1909 he became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911
        Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the
        following year to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director
        of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University
        of Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin
        until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and
        emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical
        Physics at Princeton*. He became a United States citizen in 1940 and
        retired from his post in 1945. After World War II, Einstein was a
        leading figure in the World Government Movement, he was offered the
        Presidency of the State of Israel, which he declined, and he
        collaborated with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in establishing the Hebrew
        University of Jerusalem. Einstein always appeared to have a clear view
        of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. He had a
        strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way
        to his goal. He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones
        for the next advance. At the start of his scientific work, Einstein
        realized the inadequacies of Newtonian mechanics and his special theory
        of relativity stemmed from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics
        with the laws of the electromagnetic field. He dealt with classical
        problems of statistical mechanics and problems in which they were merged
        with quantum theory: this led to an explanation of the Brownian movement
        of molecules. He investigated the thermal properties of light with a low
        radiation density and his observations laid the foundation of the photon
        theory of light.
